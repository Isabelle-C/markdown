Remember:

- Fraction is like doing division first then multiplication.

- Think division as in: I have __ number of pokemons and if I want each of __ group to have the same number of pokemons, how many pokemons should I give to each group?

- Do not think in your head, use hands or draw something to help you understand the problem.
